# CWIST - C Web development Is Still Trustworthy

CWIST is a modern, lightweight C web framework designed for building secure and scalable applications. It brings the ergonomics of modern web frameworks to C without sacrificing performance or control.

== FEATURES ==

- HTTP/1.1 Server: Robust request parsing and response handling.
- SString: Custom string library with compare and substr support.
- WebSocket Support: Easy upgrade from HTTP to persistent connections.
- Middleware System: Chainable processing for logging and security.
- Path Parameters: Express-style routing with :param support and Mux Router.
- JSON Builder: Lightweight utility using cJSON for response building.
- Static Assets & DB Sharing: Serve directories with `cwist_app_static` and reuse SQLite handles via `cwist_app_use_db`.
- Secure by Design: Built-in integration with Monocypher.
